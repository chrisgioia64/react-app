## Setup

Use Vite for the build tool instead of Webpack. See https://vite.dev/guide/ for how to get started.

I used the following command to create the project:

```npm create vite@latest```

The project uses Typescript and React.

cd into the `react-app` folder.

Run the following command to install any necessary packages into `node_modules` directory.

```npm install```

## Usage

Run the local server

```npm run dev```

Perform a build. Files are outputted to `dist` folder.

```npm run build```
